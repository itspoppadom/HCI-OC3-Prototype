# Healthcare Portal System Usability Testing Documentation

## Importance of Usability Testing

Usability testing is essential for ensuring that a product is intuitive, efficient, and accessible for users. It enhances user satisfaction by identifying and addressing challenges users face during interactions, ultimately creating a smoother experience. This helps improve productivity, reduces errors, and ensures that tasks can be completed with ease.

By resolving usability issues early, development costs are reduced, and the product becomes more accessible and inclusive. Testing also builds trust in the product and ensures it meets user needs, contributing to its overall success in real-world scenarios.

## Claims Examiner Testing Conclusion

The Healthcare Portal prototype tested well with claims examiners, with users able to complete most tasks successfully. All tasks related to reviewing claims, processing documentation, and generating reports were completed without major issues.

### Sample Usability Evaluation Observer Notes

**Project:** Healthcare Portal System

| 3    | Yes - User successfully navigated to the reports section and initiated a report download |                                                                                            |

| Task | Positive Comments                                         | Negative Comments                                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | "The color-coding makes it easy to identify claim status" | "The search function is limited to basic fields"             |
| 2    |                                                           | "The request information button doesn't seem to do anything" |
| 3    | "The report templates are very useful"                    | "Would like more customization options for reports"          |

| Task | Critical Errors                           | Non-critical Errors                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
