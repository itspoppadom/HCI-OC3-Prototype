## Overview

The Healthcare Portal is a comprehensive web-based system designed to streamline healthcare management processes. It provides role-specific dashboards and functionality for different stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, including receptionists, healthcare providers, claims examiners, and administrators.

The system aims to improve efficiency in healthcare delivery by digitizing appointment scheduling, patient management, prescription writing, claims processing, and administration tasks.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Structural Components

- **Public Pages**: Entry points for all users (Home, About, Contact)
- **Authentication Layer**: Role-based access control
- **Role-specific Dashboards**: Tailored interfaces for each user type
- **Dashboard Sections**: Specialized functionality within each dashboard
- **Shared Components**: Reusable elements across the application
- **Resources**: JavaScript and CSS files that power the application

### Technical Flow

1. Users access the system through public pages
2. Authentication assigns role-based access
3. Role-specific dashboards provide tailored functionality
4. JavaScript handles business logic and user interactions
5. CSS provides styling and responsive design

## User Roles

The system supports four primary user roles:

### Receptionist

Manages appointments, patient check-ins, and administrative tasks related to patient visits.

### Healthcare Provider

Handles patient consultations, medical records, prescriptions, and treatment plans.

### Layout Patterns

- Consistent dashboard structure across roles with left sidebar navigation
- Card-based content organization for visual grouping
- Form patterns for data entry with clear labeling
- Modal dialogs for focused tasks and detailed views
- Table patterns for data display with consistent columns

### Responsive Considerations

- Sidebar collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- Grid layouts adjust columns based on screen size
- Tables become scrollable on small screens
- Modals adjust to fit smaller screens
- Touch-friendly target sizes for mobile

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-portal.git

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd healthcare-portal
```

3. Open the application in your web browser by navigating to:

```bash

Alternatively, you can use a local development server:

### Using Python 3

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Using Node.js with http-server

```bash
npx http-server
```

Then access the application at http://localhost:8000/src/html/index.html
